    "We now turn our attention to the design of control systems using state\n",
    "space techniques. The idea is that we measure the state of the system in\n",
    "some way and adjust the inputs to modify the state behaviour. However\n",
    "this implies that we can both *observe* the states and *control* them.\n",
    "This section introduces the basic concept of observability and\n",

    "which in turn generate a set of outputs.\n",

    "we cannot influence those states from the inputs and the sub-system is\n",
    "*uncontrollable*.\n",

    "Similarly, if a sub-system is connected to the outputs $\\mathbf{y}$ then\n",

    "states of that sub-system from a knowledge of the output values.\n",
