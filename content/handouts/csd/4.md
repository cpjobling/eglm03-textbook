# 4.	Design Criteria

## 4.1	Steady-­State Criteria

These criteria are measures of the 'tracking accuracy' and robustness of control systems.

### 4.1.1	Type 0 systems: position constant ($K_p$)

For the simple, unity-gain feedback system shown in Figure 2 the error is given by<sup>3</sup>

$$E(s) = \frac{R(s)}{1 + G_o(s)}$$

For a type 0 system, the position constant, $K_p$ is the d-c open loop gain:

$$K_p = \lim_{s\to 0}\left.G_o(s)\right.$$

and implies a steady state error of

$$\frac{1}{1+K_p}$$

following a unit step input. Thus a large position constant implies a small steady state error. For a type 1 control system $G_o(s)$ contains an integration so that $K_p = \infty$ and the error tends to zero.

### 4.1.2	Type 1 systems: velocity constant ($K_v$)

For the same system,

$$K_v = \lim_{s\to 0}\;\left.sG_o(s)\right.$$

The steady state position error for a constant velocity input is $1/K_v$, so a large velocity constant implies a small steady-state error. For a type 2 system $G_o(s)$ contains two integrations so that $K_v = \infty$ and the error to a constant velocity input tends to zero.

### 4.1.3	Type 2 systems: acceleration constant ($K_a$)

Similarly

$$K_a = \lim_{s\to 0}\;\left.s^2G_o(s)\right.$$

but this is not often specified.

### 4.1.4	Compliance

For the system illustrated in Figure 3, with a disturbance $W(s)$, the error is given by

$$E(s) = \frac{R(s) + G(s)W(s)}{1+D(s)G(s)}$$

The compliance is the steady-state error following a unit step change in $W(s)$. A small compliance requires $D(s) \gg 1$ and zero compliance is obtained when $D(s)$ contains an integrator.

**Figure 3 Compliance**




### 4.1.5	Sensitivity

The sensitivity is the proportional variation in the closed-loop system caused by a variation in one of the open-loop components. A system will always be sensitive to variations of input, feedback and feed-forward paths, but the sensitivity to variations in the forward path is reduced by a factor of $1/(1 + \mathrm{loop\;gain})$.

## 4.2	Time Domain Criteria
The time domain criteria defined below are derived from the model second order under-damped output response to a step input shown in Figure 4. Similar criteria may be defined from the impulse or ramp response. The performance measures are related to the s-plane via the pole-zero diagram shown in Figure 5 where the poles are solutions of the equation

$$s^2 + 2\zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = 0$$


and $\alpha$, $\sigma$ and $\omega_d$ are defined as

$$\alpha = \cos^{-1}\zeta$$

$$\sigma = \zeta\omega_n$$

$$\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$$

**Figure 5 Location of second-­order complex poles**



### 4.2.1	Percentage overshoot ($M_p$)

Maximum difference between transient and steady state response to a unit step input. A measure of relative stability. Often quoted as a percentage of the final value of the response.

Design values: $M_p$ should be kept below 40% and < 25% is usually required. For a second order system (or a system with a pair of dominant complex poles) $M_p$ may be related to the damping ratio $\zeta$ by the equation

$$M_p = e^{-\pi\zeta/\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}\;  0 \le \zeta \lt 1$$

A plot of this curve is shown in [Figure 6](#fig6).

A useful approximation to $M_p$ is given by the straight-line equation:

$$M_p \approx 1 - \frac{\zeta}{0.6}\; 0\le \zeta \le 0.6$$

**Figure 6 Plot of the peak overshoot $M_p$ versus the damping ratio $\zeta$ for the second-­order system**


### 4.2.2	Rise time ($t_r$)

Usually defined as the time taken for the response to rise from 10% to 90% of its final value. A measure of the speed of response of the system. Figure 7 shows the relationship between normalised rise time and the damping ratio $\zeta$.

*Design values*: For a second order system (or a system with a pair of complex dominant poles) rise time may be related to the natural frequency $\omega_n$ by

$$t_r \approx \frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$$

For process control, the step response is often over-damped and an alternative definition of rise time for such a response is illustrated in Figure 8.

**Figure 7 Normalised rise time vs damping ratio for a second order system**


![Typical process response curve](images/image030.png)

**Figure 8 Typical process response curve**





### 4.2.3	Settling time ($t_s$)


Usually defined as the time taken for the response to reach and remain within some percentage of its final (steady-state) value (often 1, 2, or 5%). This parameter is related to the real part of the dominant poles $\sigma = \zeta\omega_n$. Figure 9 shows the relationship between settling time and damping ratio for 5% settling time.



![Normalised 5% settling time vs damping ratio for a second order system](images/image032.png)

**Figure 9 Normalised 5% settling time vs damping ratio for a second order system**


*Design values*: For a second order system (or a system with a pair of dominant complex poles) rise time may be related to $\sigma$ by

$${t_s} = \frac{ - \ln \left( \frac{\% \;{\kern 1pt} {\text{of}}\;{\kern 1pt} {\text{final}}\;{\kern 1pt} {\text{value}}}{100} \right)}{\sigma }$$

**Table 1 Typical settling time values**

Percentage of final value	    | 1% |	2% | 5%	| 10%
------------------------------|----|-----|----|-----------------------
Settling time $t_s$ seconds   | 4.6/$\sigma$ |  3.9/$\sigma$ | 3/$\sigma$ | 2.3/$\sigma$

Other parameters sometimes given are

### 4.2.4	Delay time ($t_d$)

Usually defined as the time taken for the response to reach 50% of its final value. An alternative definition favoured for process control (under-damped responses) is illustrated in Figure 8.

### 4.2.5	Predominant time constant ($\tau$)

Sometimes given as an alternative to $t_s$. The exponential envelope of the second order response decays to 37% of its final value in $\tau$ seconds.

*Design values*: for a second order system (or a system with a pair of dominant second order poles)

$$\tau = \frac{1}{\zeta\omega_n}.$$

The second order parameters $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$ may also be given as figures of merit. They can be useful in the design of higher order systems.

## 4.3 Frequency Domain Criteria

Frequency domain specifications are usually given in terms of the steady-state response of a system to a sinusoidal input.

### 4.3.1 Gain margin (GM)

A measure of relative stability. It is defined as the reciprocal of the magnitude of the open-loop transfer function evaluated at the frequency $\omega_\pi$, at which the phase angle is $-180^\circ$ ($-\pi$ radians). That is

$$\mathrm{GM} \equiv \frac{1}{\left|GH(j\omega_\pi)\right|}$$

where $\angle GH(j\omega_\pi) = -180^\circ = -\pi$ radians.

$\omega_\pi$ is called the 'phase-cross-over frequency'. See Figure 10 for an illustration of gain margin determination from frequency response data.

*Design values*: for absolute stability we require $\left\|GH(j\omega_\pi)\right\| <  1$ or GM > 1 (0 dB). Typical values are 3dB < GM < 8dB.

![Determination of gain margin (GM) from frequency responsediagrams](images/image034.png)

**Figure 10 Determination of gain margin (GM) from frequency response diagrams**




### 4.3.3	Phase margin (PM or $\phi_m$)

Another measure of relative stability. It is defined as $180^\circ$ plus the phase angle $\phi$ of the loop-transfer function at unity gain. That is

$$\phi_m \equiv 180^\circ + \angle GH(j\omega_1)$$

where $GH(j\omega_1) = 1$ (0 dB). Frequency $\omega_1$ is called the gain cross-over frequency. See Figure 11 for illustration of phase margin determination from frequency response data.

*Design values*: for absolute stability we require $GH(j\omega_1) < 180^\circ$ or $\phi_m > 0^\circ$. Typical values used are $\phi_m > 30^\circ$, preferably $45^\circ < \phi_m < 60^\circ$.

Note that if the Nyquist diagram is of the form illustrated in Figure 11, then $\phi_m$ is related to the damping ratio $\zeta$ by the curve illustrated in Figure 12, for which $\zeta \approx \phi_m/100$.

**Figure 12 Figure 12 Damping ratio $\zeta$ versus phase margin $\phi_m$**



### 4.3.4	Band-­width ($\omega_\mathrm{BW}$)

A measure of the speed of response of a system. In control systems, this is defined as the frequency at which the magnitude ratio $C(j\omega)/R(j\omega)$ is 3 dB down from the magnitude at $\omega = 0$. The frequency $\omega_\mathrm{BW}$ is then
equal to the cut-off frequency $\omega_c$. See Figure 13. Note that for a second-order underdamped system, $\omega_\mathrm{BW}$ is approximately equal to $2\omega_1$, where $\omega_1$ is the gain cross-over frequency.

![Typical second-­order closed-­loop frequency response](images/image043.png)

**Figure 13 Typical second-­order closed-­loop frequency response**



### 4.3.5	Cut-off rate

The rate at which the magnitude ratio decreases beyond cut-off. E.g. 6 dB/octave = 20 dB/decade.

### 4.3.6	Resonant peak ($M_\mathrm{max}$)

A good measure of stability, maximum value of the closed-loop frequency response (see Figures [13](#fig13) and [14](#fig14)).


$${M_{\max }} = \mathop {\max }\limits_\omega  \left| \frac{C(j\omega )}{R(j\omega )} \right|$$

*Design values*: a useful rule-of thumb is $M_\max =\| C(j\omega_1)\|/\|R(j\omega_1)\|$. That is the closed-loop resonant peak occurs at about the open-loop gain cross-over frequency. A more accurate value can be obtained by finding the M-circle that is tangential to the Nyquist curve (see [Section 2.3](2#s2.3)). We usually require $M_\max < 2$ (6 dB), preferably $M_\max < 1.3$ (2.3 dB).

### 4.3.7	Resonant frequency ($\omega_p$)

The frequency $\omega_p$ at which $M_\max$ occurs.

A final frequency response criterion sometimes encountered is

### 4.3.7	Delay time ($T_d$)

A measure of the speed of response is given by

$$T_d(\omega) = \frac{d\gamma}{d\omega}$$

where $\gamma = \angle C(j\omega)/R(j\omega) = $ phase of closed-loop frequency response. The average value of $T_d(\omega)$ of the frequency range of interest is usually specified.

3. for more general systems with desired output $C(s)$ and demanded output $R(s)$ the formula $E(s) = R(s) - C(s)$ must be used to derive a relationship between $E(s)$ and $R(s)$.
