# Steady-state and Transient Response

This chapter is concerned with steady-state and transient analysis of control systems.

The second-order system response and its relationship to the closed-loop poles and zeros is revised. The effect of an additional zero or an additional pole on the 2<sup>nd</sup> order response is examined and pole-zero cancellation is discussed.

System type-number and its relationship to steady-state error response is revised.

## Further Reading

The [System Metrics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/System_Metrics) section of the [Control Systems Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems) amplifies some of the topics covered in this chapter.

You should also read sections 4.2 **Time Domain Criteria** and 4.1 **Steady-State Criteria** of the [Handout](/eglm03-textbook/handouts/csd) **Control System Design Methods, Compensation Strategies and Design Criteria**.

### Text Book Readings

The topics covered in this chapter are amplified in

* Nise. Chapter 4: Time Response.
* Dorf and Bishop. Chapter 5: The Performance of Feedback Control Systems.
