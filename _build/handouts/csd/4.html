<h3 id="4.1.1---Type-0-systems:-position-constant-($K_p$)">4.1.1   Type 0 systems: position constant ($K_p$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.1.1---Type-0-systems:-position-constant-($K_p$)"> </a></h3><p>For the simple, unity-gain feedback system shown in Figure 2 the error is given by<sup>1</sup></p>
$$E(s) = \frac{R(s)}{1 + G_o(s)}$$<p>For a type 0 system, the position constant, $K_p$ is the d-c open loop gain:</p>
$$K_p = \lim_{s\to 0}\left.G_o(s)\right.$$<p>and implies a steady state error of</p>
$$\frac{1}{1+K_p}$$<p>following a unit step input. Thus a large position constant implies a small steady state error. For a type 1 control system $G_o(s)$ contains an integration so that $K_p = \infty$ and the error tends to zero.</p>

<h3 id="4.1.2---Type-1-systems:-velocity-constant-($K_v$)">4.1.2   Type 1 systems: velocity constant ($K_v$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.1.2---Type-1-systems:-velocity-constant-($K_v$)"> </a></h3><p>For the same system,</p>
$$K_v = \lim_{s\to 0}\;\left.sG_o(s)\right.$$<p>The steady state position error for a constant velocity input is $1/K_v$, so a large velocity constant implies a small steady-state error. For a type 2 system $G_o(s)$ contains two integrations so that $K_v = \infty$ and the error to a constant velocity input tends to zero.</p>
<h3 id="4.1.3---Type-2-systems:-acceleration-constant-($K_a$)">4.1.3   Type 2 systems: acceleration constant ($K_a$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.1.3---Type-2-systems:-acceleration-constant-($K_a$)"> </a></h3><p>Similarly</p>
$$K_a = \lim_{s\to 0}\;\left.s^2G_o(s)\right.$$<p>but this is not often specified.</p>
<h3 id="4.1.4---Compliance">4.1.4   Compliance<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.1.4---Compliance"> </a></h3><p>For the system illustrated in Figure 3, with a disturbance $W(s)$, the error is given by</p>
$$E(s) = \frac{R(s) + G(s)W(s)}{1+D(s)G(s)}$$<p>The compliance is the steady-state error following a unit step change in $W(s)$. A small compliance requires $D(s) \gg 1$ and zero compliance is obtained when $D(s)$ contains an integrator.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 Compliance</strong></p>
<h3 id="4.1.5---Sensitivity">4.1.5   Sensitivity<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.1.5---Sensitivity"> </a></h3><p>The sensitivity is the proportional variation in the closed-loop system caused by a variation in one of the open-loop components. A system will always be sensitive to variations of input, feedback and feed-forward paths, but the sensitivity to variations in the forward path is reduced by a factor of $1/(1 + \mathrm{loop\;gain})$.</p>
<h2 id="4.2--Time-Domain-Criteria">4.2  Time Domain Criteria<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.2--Time-Domain-Criteria"> </a></h2><p>The time domain criteria defined below are derived from the model second order under-damped output response to a step input shown in Figure 4. Similar criteria may be defined from the impulse or ramp response. The performance measures are related to the s-plane via the pole-zero diagram shown in Figure 5 where the poles are solutions of the equation</p>
$$s^2 + 2\zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = 0$$<p>and $\alpha$, $\sigma$ and $\omega_d$ are defined as</p>
$$\alpha = \cos^{-1}\zeta$$$$\sigma = \zeta\omega_n$$$$\omega_d = \omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$$<p><img src="images/image019.png" alt="Model second-­order under-­damped step response"></p>

<h3 id="4.2.1---Percentage-overshoot-($M_p$)">4.2.1   Percentage overshoot ($M_p$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.2.1---Percentage-overshoot-($M_p$)"> </a></h3><p>Maximum difference between transient and steady state response to a unit step input. A measure of relative stability. Often quoted as a percentage of the final value of the response.</p>
<p>Design values: $M_p$ should be kept below 40% and &lt; 25% is usually required. For a second order system (or a system with a pair of dominant complex poles) $M_p$ may be related to the damping ratio $\zeta$ by the equation</p>
$$M_p = e^{-\pi\zeta/\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}\;  0 \le \zeta \lt 1$$<p>A plot of this curve is shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>.</p>
<p>A useful approximation to $M_p$ is given by the straight-line equation:</p>
$$M_p \approx 1 - \frac{\zeta}{0.6}\; 0\le \zeta \le 0.6$$<p><img src="images/image026.png" alt="Plot of the peak overshoot Mp versus the damping ratio zeta for the second-­order system"></p>

A measure of the speed of response of the system. Figure 7 shows the relationship between normalised rise time and the damping ratio $\zeta$.</p>
<p><em>Design values</em>: For a second order system (or a system with a pair of complex dominant poles) rise time may be related to the natural frequency $\omega_n$ by</p>
$$t_r \approx \frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$$<p>For process control, the step response is often over-damped and an alternative definition of rise time for such a response is illustrated in Figure 8.</p>

This parameter is related to the real part of the dominant poles $\sigma = \zeta\omega_n$. Figure 9 shows the relationship between settling time and damping ratio for 5% settling time.</p>

<p>Other parameters sometimes given are</p>
<h3 id="4.2.4---Delay-time-($t_d$)">4.2.4   Delay time ($t_d$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.2.4---Delay-time-($t_d$)"> </a></h3><p>Usually defined as the time taken for the response to reach 50% of its final value. An alternative definition favoured for process control (under-damped responses) is illustrated in Figure 8.</p>
<h3 id="4.2.5---Predominant-time-constant-($\tau$)">4.2.5   Predominant time constant ($\tau$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.2.5---Predominant-time-constant-($\tau$)"> </a></h3><p>Sometimes given as an alternative to $t_s$. The exponential envelope of the second order response decays to 37% of its final value in $\tau$ seconds.</p>
<p><em>Design values</em>: for a second order system (or a system with a pair of dominant second order poles)</p>
$$\tau = \frac{1}{\zeta\omega_n}.$$<p>The second order parameters $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$ may also be given as figures of merit. They can be useful in the design of higher order systems.</p>
<h2 id="4.3-Frequency-Domain-Criteria">4.3 Frequency Domain Criteria<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.3-Frequency-Domain-Criteria"> </a></h2><p>Frequency domain specifications are usually given in terms of the steady-state response of a system to a sinusoidal input.</p>
<h3 id="4.3.1-Gain-margin-(GM)">4.3.1 Gain margin (GM)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.3.1-Gain-margin-(GM)"> </a></h3><p>A measure of relative stability. It is defined as the reciprocal of the magnitude of the open-loop transfer function evaluated at the frequency $\omega_\pi$, at which the phase angle is $-180^\circ$ ($-\pi$ radians). That is</p>
$$\mathrm{GM} \equiv \frac{1}{\left|GH(j\omega_\pi)\right|}$$<p>where $\angle GH(j\omega_\pi) = -180^\circ = -\pi$ radians.</p>
<p>$\omega_\pi$ is called the 'phase-cross-over frequency'. See Figure 10 for an illustration of gain margin determination from frequency response data.</p>
<p><em>Design values</em>: for absolute stability we require $\left\|GH(j\omega_\pi)\right\| &lt;  1$ or GM &gt; 1 (0 dB). Typical values are 3dB &lt; GM &lt; 8dB.</p>
<p><img src="images/image034.png" alt="Determination of gain margin (GM) from frequency responsediagrams"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 10 Determination of gain margin (GM) from frequency response diagrams</strong></p>
<h3 id="4.3.3---Phase-margin-(PM-or-$\phi_m$)">4.3.3   Phase margin (PM or $\phi_m$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.3.3---Phase-margin-(PM-or-$\phi_m$)"> </a></h3><p>Another measure of relative stability. It is defined as $180^\circ$ plus the phase angle $\phi$ of the loop-transfer function at unity gain. That is</p>
$$\phi_m \equiv 180^\circ + \angle GH(j\omega_1)$$<p>where $GH(j\omega_1) = 1$ (0 dB). Frequency $\omega_1$ is called the gain cross-over frequency. See Figure 11 for illustration of phase margin determination from frequency response data.</p>
<p><em>Design values</em>: for absolute stability we require $GH(j\omega_1) &lt; 180^\circ$ or $\phi_m &gt; 0^\circ$. Typical values used are $\phi_m &gt; 30^\circ$, preferably $45^\circ &lt; \phi_m &lt; 60^\circ$.</p>
<p>Note that if the Nyquist diagram is of the form illustrated in Figure 11, then $\phi_m$ is related to the damping ratio $\zeta$ by the curve illustrated in Figure 12, for which $\zeta \approx \phi_m/100$.</p>

In control systems, this is defined as the frequency at which the magnitude ratio $C(j\omega)/R(j\omega)$ is 3 dB down from the magnitude at $\omega = 0$. The frequency $\omega_\mathrm{BW}$ is then
equal to the cut-off frequency $\omega_c$. See Figure 13. Note that for a second-order underdamped system, $\omega_\mathrm{BW}$ is approximately equal to $2\omega_1$, where $\omega_1$ is the gain cross-over frequency.</p>

<h3 id="4.3.6---Resonant-peak-($M_\mathrm{max}$)">4.3.6   Resonant peak ($M_\mathrm{max}$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.3.6---Resonant-peak-($M_\mathrm{max}$)"> </a></h3><p>A good measure of stability, maximum value of the closed-loop frequency response (see Figures <a href="#fig13">13</a> and <a href="#fig14">14</a>).</p>
$${M_{\max }} = \mathop {\max }\limits_\omega  \left| \frac{C(j\omega )}{R(j\omega )} \right|$$<p><em>Design values</em>: a useful rule-of thumb is $M_\max =\| C(j\omega_1)\|/\|R(j\omega_1)\|$. That is the closed-loop resonant peak occurs at about the open-loop gain cross-over frequency. A more accurate value can be obtained by finding the M-circle that is tangential to the Nyquist curve (see <a href="2#s2.3">Section 2.3</a>). We usually require $M_\max &lt; 2$ (6 dB), preferably $M_\max &lt; 1.3$ (2.3 dB).</p>
<h3 id="4.3.7---Resonant-frequency-($\omega_p$)">4.3.7   Resonant frequency ($\omega_p$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.3.7---Resonant-frequency-($\omega_p$)"> </a></h3><p>The frequency $\omega_p$ at which $M_\max$ occurs.</p>
<p>A final frequency response criterion sometimes encountered is</p>
<h3 id="4.3.7---Delay-time-($T_d$)">4.3.7   Delay time ($T_d$)<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.3.7---Delay-time-($T_d$)"> </a></h3><p>A measure of the speed of response is given by</p>
$$T_d(\omega) = \frac{d\gamma}{d\omega}$$<p>where $\gamma = \angle C(j\omega)/R(j\omega) = $ phase of closed-loop frequency response. The average value of $T_d(\omega)$ of the frequency range of interest is usually specified.</p>
