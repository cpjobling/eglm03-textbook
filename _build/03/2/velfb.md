# Velocity feedback design

This chapter is concerned with steady-state and transient analysis of control systems.

Second-order system response and its relationship to the closed-loop poles and zeros is revised. The effect of an additional zero or an additional pole on the 2nd order response is examined; and pole-zero cancellation is discussed.

System type number and its relationship to steady-state error response is revised.
