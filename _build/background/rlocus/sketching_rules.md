# What are the rules for sketching a root locus?

I hope to be able to find the time to create a pencast on this topic, but in the mean-time try asking the question on Google: [What are the rules for sketching a root locus?](http://www.google.co.uk/search?&q=What+are+the+rules+for+sketching+a+root+locus%3F). There are a lot of useful resources but you won't learn the rules by reading them, you have to try some examples -- practice makes perfect. Here are some resources that I picked out as useful:

* There is a section on this topic in the recommended reading for this module, The Control Theory Wikibook: [Root Locus](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Root_Locus)
* [Rules for Making Root Locus Plots](http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/RootLocusReviewRules.html) by Eric Deever of the Department of Engineering at Swarthmore College (USA), and
* [Root Locus Sketching Rules](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-004-systems-modeling-and-control-ii-fall-2007/lecture-notes/lecture18.pdf), from MIT OpenCourseware.

(Don't just stop at the page links given here, explore the rest of these sites as well.)

An additional tip: a benefit of having access to Matlab is that you can easily plot a root locus to see what the answer should be. Try looking up "`help rlocus`" for usage information.
