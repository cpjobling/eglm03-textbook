There are a lot of useful resources but you won't learn the rules by reading them, you have to try some examples -- practice makes perfect. Here are some resources that I picked out as useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a section on this topic in the recommended reading for this module, The Control Theory Wikibook: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Root_Locus">Root Locus</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/RootLocusReviewRules.html">Rules for Making Root Locus Plots</a> by Eric Deever of the Department of Engineering at Swarthmore College (USA), and</li>
<li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-004-systems-modeling-and-control-ii-fall-2007/lecture-notes/lecture18.pdf">Root Locus Sketching Rules</a>, from MIT OpenCourseware.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Don't just stop at the page links given here, explore the rest of these sites as well.)</p>
<p>An additional tip: a benefit of having access to Matlab is that you can easily plot a root locus to see what the answer should be. Try looking up "<code>help rlocus</code>" for usage information.</p>
