<h1 id="Modelling-Systems-in-State-Space">Modelling Systems in State-Space<a class="anchor-link" href="#Modelling-Systems-in-State-Space"> </a></h1><p>State-space models are fundamental to the so-called "Modern Control System" design methods. They are also key to the numerical tools that are provided in the MATLAB Control Systems toolbox. In this chapter we shall introduce the idea of state-space models and explore some of their properties.</p>
<p>These topics will also give you further insight into the integral models used in Simulink.</p>
