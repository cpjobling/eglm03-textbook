<h1 id="State-Space-Design-of-Control-Systems">State Space Design of Control Systems<a class="anchor-link" href="#State-Space-Design-of-Control-Systems"> </a></h1><p>We now turn our attention to the design of control systems using state space
techniques. The idea is that we measure the state of the system in some way and
adjust the inputs to modify the state behaviour. However this implies that we can
both observe the states and control them. 
<a href="1/observ_ctrl">Section 8.1 Observers and Controllers</a> 
introduces the basic concept of observability and controllability. We then go on to discuss 
<a href="2/sfcontrol">State-Feedback Control</a> 
and 
<a href="3/observers">State Observers</a> 
before concluding with a look at the structure and dynamics of the 
<a href="4/observer_controller">Combined Observer and Controller</a>.</p>
