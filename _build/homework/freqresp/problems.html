<li><p>The uncompensated loop-transfer function of a system is $$G(s)H(s)=\frac{2}{s(s+2)}.$$ Assuming unity-gain feedback, design a cascade lead compensator to achieve a velocity constant
$K_v$ of 20 and a phase margin of 45°.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design a lag compensator for the system of Question 1 to achieve the same design constraints. Compare the relative merits of the two approaches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The open-loop transfer function of a position control system is $$Go(s)=\frac{25}{s\left(1+\frac{1}{4}s\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{16}s\right)}.$$ The system's gain and phase margin are to exceed 1.5 and 15° respectively. Determine whether these specification are satisfied and if not design a lead compensator to meet the specifications
and also to maintain the open-loop gain at 25.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using frequency response methods, design a compensator to achieve a step-response with a rise
time $t_r \le 0.4$ s, a peak overshoot $\%OS \le 20\%$ and a step error constant $K_p = 20$ for the system
with plant transfer function $$\frac{3}{(s+1)(s+3)}.$$ Estimate the closed-loop bandwidth of the compensated system and the resonant peak $M_{\mathrm{max}}$·</p>
</li>
<li><p>A type 2 servomechanism has transfer function $$G(s)H(s) = \frac{0.25}{s^2(1+0.25s)},\;H(s)=1.$$ Show the effect on stability of adding the cascade lead network: $$D(s)=\frac{1}{16}\left(\frac{1+4s}{1+0.25s}\right)$$ and a pre-amplifier with gain $K_p = 16$.</p>
</li>
<li>Repeat the design of Question 4 using the w-transform method to determine the parameters of a suitable digital compensator. Assume that the sampling frequency $\omega_s = 10\omega_{\mathrm{Bw}}$. Write down the
difference equation of the resulting digital compensator.</li>
