# Textbook for EGLM03 Modern Control Systems

This is the source code for the course notes for EGLM03 Modern Control Systems.

It is a collection of Markdown pages and Jupyter Notebooks. 

The Jupyter Notebooks can be presented as pages and slides. They use the MATLAB kernel and after some setup the notebooks can be downloaded and they become executable documents.

The published version of the textbook is **[EGLM03 Modern Control Systems](http://cpjobling.github.io/eglm03-textbook)**.

## About this book

There is a guide and template for hosting your own book using
Jupyter Notebooks and Jekyll.

Here are some highlights:

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* This site comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`)
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.

See **[A short guide to deploying your own textbook](https://jupyterbook.org/guide/01_overview)**.
