    "3. A numerical path-controlled turret lathe control system is illustrated in Figure 1. The gear ratio is $n = 0.1$, the motor inertia is $J = 10^{- 3}$ kg.m<sup>2</sup> and  the motor resistance is $R = 10^{-2}$ Nm/(rad/s). It is necessary to attain an accuracy of 0.5 thousandths of an inch in the position of the cutting tool relative to the workpiece and therefore a position accuracy of 1% is required for a ramp input. Design a cascade controller, to be inserted before the silicon-controlled-rectifiers (SCRs), in order to provide a step command with an overshoot of less than 2%. A suitable damping ratio for the system is 0.8. The gain of the SCRs is $K_r = 5$.\n",
