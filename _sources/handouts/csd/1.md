# 1. Aims of Control Systems Analysis and Design

## 1.1 Analysis

* *Objectives*: Determination of the following system characteristics:
    * degree and extent of system stability
    *	steady-state (d-c) performance (accuracy)
    *	transient performance
* *Methods of analysis*
    * determine differential equations or transfer functions for each component
    * choose suitable representation, e.g. block diagram
    *	formulate system model by connecting components together
    * *determine system response*.

    For the latter there are several methods used:

    * Direct solution to find steady-state and transient solutions. (Difficult with high order systems -- relative stability difficult to study in time domain)
    * Four graphical methods (described in Section 2)

        * Root locus
        * Bode diagram
        * Nyquist diagram
        *	Nichols chart

        (The last three are all frequency response methods)

## 1.2 Design Objectives

To meet performance specifications. Performance specifications are constraints on the system characteristics which are a number of ways of specifying these constraints. These fall into two broad classes

* *Time domain criteria*
* *Frequency domain criteria*

The required response is prescribed in either or both forms. In general, the constraints define:

*	speed of response
*	relative stability
*	system accuracy or allowable error.

These are described in [Section 4](4).
