    "The PID compensator raises the system type number by 1. It also introduces two zeros which can be used to improve the transient response. Root locus methods can be used to locate these zeros in order to satisfy the steady-state and transient response requirements of a design. We shall illustrate the [Zeigler-Nichols method](../1/zeigler) next. There is also an [analytical technique](../3/analpid) for achieving a specified steady-state error performance and defined dominant poles. In industrial practice, however, it is quite common to tune a PID compensator \"in the loop\" and this is discussed in a companion document ([Tuning a PID Compensator](../2/tuning)). The tuning rules are essentially summarised \n",

    "1. Increasing reset rate and proportional gain increases the speed of response and reduces the steady-state error.\n",
